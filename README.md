# Speedrunning-Strats-Remastered
Strats mod with customisable settings to suit any runner

This mod allows runners of The Simpsons: Hit and Run to practice the strats they use when enabled as a mod in the Lucas' Mod Launcher. 

There are multiple settings to use, such as practicing out of bounds in level 7, practicing escapes or changing spawn locations in order to try strats or destroy different cars in destruction missions. The options are not limited to this. 

The mod enables UnlockAllMissions and UnlockAllRewards automatically, so there is no need to manually go and enable them. When the mod is disabled, it also disables those two mods. It also removes the introduction cutscenes in the mod.
